Technology and System-specific Notes
------------------------------------
Flexbox layout is used which makes laying out items in a container more efficient even when the size is unknown or dynamic. It helped  making the page more responsive.

srcset is used to supply different resolution images. The browser picks up the right image based on display size and device pixel ratio. 

The webpage was tested on Chrome and Edge browsers. To test responsiveness on other devices, Chrome Developer Tools' device emulator was used. Apart from other devices, the page was tested for Desktop, Mobile(Google Nexus 5) and Tablet (Apple iPad).

Main technology involved is HTML5 and CSS.
